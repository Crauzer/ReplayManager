# ReplayManager

Goals:

Remove the limitation of the League Clients ability of downloading Replays. 

Store a separate client which can be forward/backwards patched in order to play older replays.


Info:

Replays are currently stored on Riot Servers for 30 days, League Client stops users from download Replays from an older patch and only lets users download replays from their last 20 matches.
